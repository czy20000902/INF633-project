# Limitation:
Due to time limit, we haven't put:
 - distance to obstacle(steepness of one position on the terrain, if the steepness is too large, this position can not be reachable)
 - distance that quadruped has already moved
 - angle that quadrued has already roated
 - probability to wait, turn around, move straight
 - etc. \
these factors as *INPUT* for the brain(*NeuralNet*), but we did use these factors in decision making.
